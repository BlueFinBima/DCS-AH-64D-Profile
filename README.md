# DCS-AH-64D-Profile

[Download Current Release](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/DCS-AH-64D-Profile/releases/Latest)

This is a Helios profile for the DCS AH-64D Apache.  It is intended to be used with the
dedicated Helios interfance shipped with 1.6.5300.x.  As such, it makes use of specific
panels which are integrated into that release of Helios.
 
The CMWS, EUFDs, KUs MFDs & TEDAC are all modelled as Helios gauges with the ability to
auto-bind to the AH-64D profile.  This means that if the AH-64D interface is added in the
Helioos Profile Editor, and one of these gauges is applied from the toolbox, then there
should be no need to manually bind the gauge.
